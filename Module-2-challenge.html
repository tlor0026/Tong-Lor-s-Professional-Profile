                    <p>I have been in the IT feild for about 7 years now. It is an absolute joy seeing how the technology field is growing. The majority of my work years in the IT field have been in the help desk/service department. 
                    Through this, i've gained an abundance of skills to will prove usefull in my future endevors. I love troubleshooting issues and it is just so satifying to me when i am able to come to a conclusing using what i've learned.
                    Im am always looking for ways to enhance my knowledge therefor i made the change into the coding feild. I feel that it is naturally the next step in my field.
